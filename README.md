# SQL Database Design and Implementation

This repository contains SQL scripts for a project focused on database design, normalization, and implementation using SQL. It is based on a project for a university assignment, where the goal was to normalize data and work with SQL queries to create and manage the database.

## Project Overview

This project involved the following key steps:
1. **Database Normalization**: From Unnormalized Form (UNF) to Third Normal Form (3NF).
2. **SQL Queries**: 
   - Creating tables, inserting data, and performing complex queries like joins, aggregate functions (SUM, MAX, MIN), and data updates.

## Repository Structure

- `SQL/`: Contains SQL scripts to:
   - Create database tables
   - Insert data into the tables
   - Perform various SQL operations (e.g., SELECT, JOIN, SUM, etc.)
- `README.md`: This file provides a project overview and instructions.
